<% title 'Step by Step Tutorials' %>

Spine has a number of guides that take you step by step building example applications, as well as examples of real-world applications.

##Tutorials

1. If you're using the building your Spine applications in [pure JavaScript](<%= docs_path("started_js") %>), without using Node or Hem, then the [TodoList guide](<%= docs_path("example_tasks") %>) is the one for you. It takes you through building a basic CRUD application, including model persistence using HTML5 Local Storage.

1. Otherwise, if you're using [CoffeeScript and Hem](<%= docs_path("started") %>), you should checkout the [Contacts guide](<%= docs_path("example_contacts") %>), which will take you through all the steps necessary for building a fully fledged contacts manager, including CRUD, Stacks and search.

##Example applications

Once you're familiar with guides, you may want to browse some source code and see Spine in action. I find this is one of the best ways of learning a new language or framework, especially when it comes to best practices. 

Spine has a number of these [example applications](<%= pages_path("examples") %>), such as a todo's list, a contacts manager, and some more advanced examples like a chat room.

##Screencasts

Another great way of learning is through screencasts. So far, Spine has [four screencasts](<%= pages_path("screencasts") %>) on subjects ranging from Rails integration, realtime sync and infinite scroll. If you've got any suggestions on further additional subjects for screencasts, please [get in contact](<%= pages_path("community") %>).
